Getting Started
===============

Please first install my favorite package ``numpy``.

.. code:: python

    print('this is a Jupyter code cell')


.. parsed-literal::
    :class: output

    this is a Jupyter code cell


Images
------

We can put the image caption in ``[]``. In addition, we can use
``:width:`` followed by its value in an inline block to specify the
image width, similarly use ``:height:``\ for height.

.. figure:: assets/koebel-16489559658632.jpg
   :width: 400px

   Estimating the length of a foot


SVG Image
---------

We recommend you to use SVG images as much as you can. It is sharp and
its size is small. But since Latex doesnâ€™t support SVG images, if you
want to build a PDF output, you need to install ``rsvg-convert``. On
Macos, you can simply ``brew install librsvg`` or
``sudo apt-get install librsvg2-bin`` for Ubuntu.

.. figure:: ./assets/lstm.svg

   A LSTM Cell in SVG

Tables
------

You can insert table caption before the table by starting it with a
``:``. Note that you need to leave an empty line between the caption and
the table itself.

.. table:: The number is computed by
   :math:`z_{ij} = \sum_{k}x_{ik}y_{kj}`.
